# Greetings from Niklas
# Enjoy your stay


# Here is a little easter egg story:
# There once was a little robot called Friend-ly living on a little muddy hill next to his town.
# He was a very friendly and famous robot and crawling the web in his free time searching for funny
# posts on Mastodon. Every time he found one, he was happy.
# But one day he recognized that the best thing about crawling the web are the connections to real humans.
# From this day on he opened Mastodon to communicate with his human friends instead of crawling the web
# to find new posts. 
# And we as humans should do either.
# Find new friends
# Start something new
# Make the world better
# [Work, Love, Spent time] Together (not against)
